So while I may have a slightly different experience from those who started in NMD, I do have some experience outside of NMD that I can share. Along with majoring in NMD, I am also minoring in both Game Design and the Japanese Language. So basically, I am really into video games as well as Japanese pop culture such as anime and J-Pop music, and I've even been to Japan twice. To be honest, I am definitely on the more introverted side, but I also consider myself very friendly and open to meeting new people! When I was still part of the IGM department, I even participated on the IGM Ambassador team where I spoke about my major with new students and parents, so I think I definitely have the social and leadership skills to be a good new media mentor. Because I transferred into this major so late, I don't really know many of my current classmates. Everyone already has their current friend groups, so I'd love to have the opportunity to meet more new people in my new major! I hope it's okay that I wrote this much.",
